# liri


In this assignment, I made my version of LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

-------------Twitter API-------------------

Liri will display last 20 tweets tweeted by the one and only, twitter master - Our President.

Love him or hate him, Mr Trump has entertained and shocked us with his regular tweets, often sent late at night. His tweets carry tremendous power, affecting us all in some form or another. Thats why it is necessary to be up to date and never miss his tweet. 

Typing in "my-tweets" in the arguments loads his latest rant on twitter.
